# 🎯 Gucci's Target Customer Segmentation – A Clustering Approach

Welcome to a fun dive into **unsupervised learning** using Hierarchical Clustering! In this project, I explore customer segmentation using the classic `Mall_Customers.csv` dataset revealing hidden patterns and natural groupings based on spending behavior and income.

## ✨ What’s Inside?

- 🎯 Goal: Segment mall customers into meaningful clusters
- 📊 Dataset: Mall Customers
- 🧠 Method: Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering
- 🌐 Tools: Dendrograms, Distance Matrices, and Cluster Visualizations

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Libraries: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scipy`, `sklearn`

---

## 🔍 What I Learned

- How hierarchical clustering helps when you **don’t know** the number of clusters
- The power of dendrograms to reveal natural divisions in data
- Visual intuition for how customer segments emerge based on similarity
